## Reproduction Boundary

This public case includes paper-derived code, generated data, generated figures, public validation checks, and explanatory notes. It does not redistribute the paper PDF, arXiv source archive, original figures, EPS paths, digitized source curves, source-derived point sets, or source-vs-generated composite panels.

Remaining limitation: The case includes an A100-SXM4-80GB 127x127 to 101x101 geometry probe and paper-scale P2WGS at N=10201. Full million-sample GNN training was stopped after the strict metric-contract gate failed; the unavailable GPU-parallel auction kernel is not replaced by CPU timing claims.

Final-parameter rule: final public figures use the paper parameters when feasible. Any reduced-scale, subset, proxy, or blocked target must be labeled explicitly and cannot be presented as a complete reproduction.
