# Similarity Scorecard

## Case Score

- Overall score: **75.21/100**
- Similarity level: `numerical_feature_reproduction`
- Meaning: central analytic dynamics and disclosed tables reproduce quantitatively; source-constrained and proxy-model targets capture the paper feature without claiming author-run identity.

The score evaluates numerical content rather than color, line width, marker, layout, or camera choice.

## Pixel Gate

- Exact source canvas size: **8/8**
- Best full-image SSIM: **0.8297** (T012)
- Mean full-image SSIM: **0.7524**
- Strict `SSIM >= 0.95`: **0/8**
- Formal layout-contract evidence: **3/3 passed** for T001, T003, and T007

This presentation gate is reported separately and does not increase the 75.21 scientific score. The other five rendered figures remain outside the formal pixel frontier because their formula/provenance gates are reconstructed, source-only, or proxy-model constrained.

| Target | Weight | Score | Stage | Parameter match | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| T001 Fig. 2 | 3.0 | 80 | final_reproduction | paper_exact | exact closure/CZ dynamics; source data points unavailable |
| T002 Fig. 3 | 1.5 | 50 | exploratory | unknown | duration surrogate matches endpoints; schedules absent |
| T003 Fig. 4 | 1.5 | 76 | exploratory | paper_subset | 2 mm timing crossover; panel-b source inconsistency |
| T004 Table S1 | 0.7 | 99 | final_reproduction | paper_exact | operating point agrees after paper rounding |
| T005 Table S2 | 0.7 | 100 | final_reproduction | paper_exact | decay conversion exact |
| T007 Fig. S1 | 1.3 | 80 | exploratory | paper_subset | exact modes and independent 25-segment closure |
| T008 Fig. S3 | 1.0 | 55 | exploratory | proxy_model | thermal trend and `η²` scaling only |
| T009 Table S7 | 0.5 | 100 | final_reproduction | paper_exact | gate accounting exact |
| T010 Fig. S5 | 0.9 | 80 | exploratory | paper_exact | disclosed Fowler projection, no MC markers |
| T011 Table S13 | 0.7 | 89 | exploratory | paper_exact | circular-state formula anchors |
| T012 Fig. S6 | 0.8 | 55 | exploratory | proxy_model | unitary trajectory plus disclosed decay approximation |
| T013 Fig. S7 | 0.8 | 55 | exploratory | proxy_model | thermal ordering and floors only |
| T014 Table S14 | 0.6 | 89 | exploratory | paper_exact | disclosed error-budget arithmetic |

## What Prevents A Higher Score

The limiting evidence is scientific input, not plotting fidelity: no raw author curves, no exact multi-ion toggle schedule, no MQDT state-tracking dataset, no qLDPC simulator/decoder configuration, and no full open-system notebook. T003 also cannot be awarded source-raster agreement because its panel-b raster contradicts the caption formula.
