Public status: **Pixel-audited numerical feature reproduction** · Audit score: **80.00/100**

Independently reproduces the calibrated one- and two-photon Bose–Hubbard dynamics, information-spreading observables, interaction-induced antibunching, and double-occupancy suppression. A supplemental scalar-field pixel audit covers the theoretical interiors of Figs. S14–S20.

## Reproduction Boundary

This public case includes paper-derived code, generated data, generated figures, public validation checks, and explanatory notes. It does not redistribute the paper PDF, arXiv source archive, original figures, EPS paths, digitized source curves, source-derived point sets, or source-vs-generated composite panels.

Remaining limitation: Author theory tables, experimental shots, and tomography arrays are unavailable. Publisher rasters are used only for internal validation and are not redistributed; the S20 correlator audit remains visibly weaker than the density panels.

Final-parameter rule: final public figures use the paper parameters when feasible. Any reduced-scale, subset, proxy, or blocked target must be labeled explicitly and cannot be presented as a complete reproduction.
