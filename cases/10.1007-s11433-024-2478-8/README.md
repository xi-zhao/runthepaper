Reproduces the buffer-atom-mediated CZ gate from an independent three-body Rydberg Hamiltonian: single-photon waveforms, populations, and phases (Fig. 3, complete, gate error < 1e-4), the two-photon protocol (Fig. 4), the Doppler-insensitive dual-pulse upgrade (Fig. 5), and the amplitude-ratio robustness map (Fig. 7).

## Paper Reference vs Independent Reproduction

The left column in each panel is a limited excerpt from Y. Sun, [Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. 67, 120311 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11433-024-2478-8); the right column is generated independently from this case. These comparisons validate physical structure and key numerical features, not author-data-level or point-for-point equivalence.

## Reproduction Boundary

This public case includes paper-derived code, generated data, generated figures, public validation checks, explanatory notes, and 4 limited comparison panels. Those panels use the minimum paper excerpts needed for validation and clearly separate the paper reference from the independent result. The case does not redistribute the paper PDF, arXiv source archive, standalone original figures, EPS paths, digitized source curves, or source-derived point sets.

Remaining limitation: The two-photon full three-level model gives gate error ~1e-3 vs the paper's <1e-4 (its waveforms were likely optimised in a reduced/effective model); Fig. 7 peak ~25% below the paper; Fig. 6 three-qubit Toffoli geometry is underspecified and not reproduced; Figs. a6-a8 have no published coefficients.

Final-parameter rule: final public figures use the paper parameters when feasible. Any reduced-scale, subset, proxy, or blocked target must be labeled explicitly and cannot be presented as a complete reproduction.
