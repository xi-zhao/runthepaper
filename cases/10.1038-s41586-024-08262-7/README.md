Public status: **Complete reproduction** · Audit score: **90.00/100**

Reproduces the numerical main figure from the paper's closed-form single-mode statistics at the published legend parameters, and independently validates the free-paraparticle spectrum of the one-dimensional solvable spin model by exact diagonalization.

## Reproduction Boundary

This public case includes paper-derived code, generated data, generated figures, public validation checks, and explanatory notes. It does not redistribute the paper PDF, arXiv source archive, original figures, EPS paths, digitized source curves, source-derived point sets, or source-vs-generated composite panels.

Remaining limitation: The Nature figure is raster-only and no author plotting-data table is available, so the comparison tier is analytic-reference rather than author-data pointwise. The two-dimensional KDH model, eight-body plaquette terms, and braiding demonstration are outside this case's scope.

Final-parameter rule: final public figures use the paper parameters when feasible. Any reduced-scale, subset, proxy, or blocked target must be labeled explicitly and cannot be presented as a complete reproduction.
