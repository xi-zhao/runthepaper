# Contributing

RunThePaper accepts contributions that make a reproduction case more accurate,
clear, runnable, or honest.

Good contributions include:

- fixing a derivation mistake;
- improving a numerical method;
- adding a missing validation check;
- reducing ambiguity in a reproduction note;
- reporting a mismatch between generated results and the paper;
- adding a new case with clear evidence boundaries.

Please do not add original paper PDFs, publisher source archives, or original
figure assets unless the license explicitly allows redistribution and the case
documents that permission.

Limited source-versus-reproduction comparison panels are allowed only when they
are necessary for validation. Use the minimum source excerpt, label both sides,
cite the official paper, keep the standalone source panel out of the repository,
and state that visual agreement is not author-data-level equivalence.

Every formula/theory case must ship, so readers can follow the science:

- an **equation-level derivation** at `docs/DERIVATION.md` — the actual equations
  the reproduction depends on, in the order understand → derive → numericalize.
  It is generated from the reproduction's equation cards, not hand-written after
  the fact, and the numerical code must follow the derivation, not precede it;
- **source-vs-reproduction comparison panels** under `docs/comparisons/` for the
  reproduced figures (see the limited-excerpt rules above).

Algorithm/benchmark cases substitute a method/algorithm trace for the derivation.

For each case, keep the public boundary clear:

- generated data belongs in `outputs/data/`;
- generated figures belong in `outputs/figures/`;
- limited validation comparison panels belong in `docs/comparisons/`;
- validation results belong in `outputs/checks/`;
- paper/source references should be links or citations, not copied raw assets.

In `cases/catalog.json`, record the preprint and formal publication as separate
objects. A published entry needs its formal title, venue, full citation, DOI,
and article/page/PII locator. If no formal publication can be found, use
`publication.status: "not_recorded"` together with `checked_at`; do not use an
empty DOI as an implicit status.

## Before Opening a Pull Request

Regenerate navigation after adding or changing a catalog entry:

```bash
python scripts/render_case_catalog.py
```

Then verify the public package:

```bash
python scripts/render_case_catalog.py --check
python scripts/validate_public_cases.py
python -m compileall -q scripts cases
```
